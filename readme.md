# SoundShift Player
## Project Overview
**SoundShift Player** is a custom-built music player designed for the development of Spotify extensions. **SoundShift Player** simulates the key functionality of Spotify in order to bypass any rate limits imposed with the Spotify API.

The core functionality of **SoundShift** is to enforce a listening policy that prevents users from hearing the same song too frequently. This often occurs on major music platforms when the user recursively searches for similar music, such as repeatedly clicking 'create radio station' from within a radio station. **SoundShift** addresses this issue by notifying the user, so that they can search for new music, or by automatically skipping certain songs.
